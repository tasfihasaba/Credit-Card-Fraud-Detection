# Credit Card Fraud Detection

Retaining highly profitable customers is often a bank's top priority in terms of commercial objectives. 
But for several banks, banking fraud represents a serious threat to achieving this objective. This is
a problematic situation for both banks and customers in terms of significant financial losses, trust, 
and reputation. 

Machine learning-based credit card fraud detection in the banking sector is not just a trend, but also a 
requirement for them to set up proactive monitoring and fraud protection procedures. These institutions 
are using machine learning to cut down on time-consuming manual reviews, pricey chargebacks and penalties, 
and denials of valid transactions. 

In this project, With the aid of machine learning models, I identified fraudulent credit card transactions. 

This data set includes credit card transactions made by European cardholders over a period of two days in September 2013. There were 492 fraudulent transactions out of a total of 2,84,807 transactions. The positive class (frauds) accounts for 0.172% of total transactions in this data set, which is highly unbalanced. To maintain confidentiality, the data set was also modified using principal component analysis (PCA). Aside from 'time' and 'amount,' all of the other features (V1, V2, V3, and so on) are the primary components obtained through PCA. The 'time' feature stores the seconds that passed between the first transaction in the data set and the subsequent transactions. The 'amount' feature represents the transaction amount. The 'class' feature represents class labeling and has a value of 1 in cases of fraud and 0 in others.
