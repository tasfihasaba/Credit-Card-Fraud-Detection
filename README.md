# Credit Card Fraud Detection

Retaining highly profitable customers is often a bank's top priority in terms of commercial objectives. 
But for several banks, banking fraud represents a serious threat to achieving this objective. This is
a problematic situation for both banks and customers in terms of significant financial losses, trust, 
and reputation. 

Machine learning-based credit card fraud detection in the banking sector is not just a trend, but also a 
requirement for them to set up proactive monitoring and fraud protection procedures. These institutions 
are using machine learning to cut down on time-consuming manual reviews, pricey chargebacks and penalties, 
and denials of valid transactions. 

In this project, With the aid of machine learning models, we will identify fraudulent credit card transactions. 



Below, I'm checking the correlation in heatmap by passing the Correlation object.
Dark-red shows strongly correlated. 
Light-orange shows it is not so highly correlated.
